# DS340W - Course Project

This GitHub repository is for academic purposes only. The materials uploaded here is for a course project on Applied Data Science.

DS 340 W is a course focusing on Applied Data Science, offered at The Pennsylvania State University - Main Campus (University Park, PA).

## Repository Contents

The following is a overview the contents of this DS340W - Course Project repository. All reference links will be provided to the original source. ALl code and data access credit goes to the original publishers.

### Datasets

'us_disaster_declarations.csv' - This is the data set that is used by the 'DS340W-ParentPaperCode.ipynb'.

This was originally published on the website Kaggle.

### Code

'DS340W-ParentPaperCode.ipynb' - This .ipynb file is the code that will run the full exploratory data analysis and produce the heat map that shows a breakdown of the results from the data analysis. 

-- Code was altered from original source. --
* Removed unneeded data queries.
* Changed data input method to get data from Google Drive and not directly from Kaggle webpage.

The heatmap from this code is showing similar results to what we see in my parent paper (which will be linked below). This parent paper focuses more on detecting natural disasters, while the code in this repository focuses on a breakdown of already occurred natural disasters, thus complimenting each other in content.

'DS340W-ModifiedCode.ipynb' - Altered code file that deletes unneeded data observations, cleans up code, adds comments, and adds full time series analysis as well as full machine learning analysis for predicting the frequency of natural disasters in specific disaster prone areas in the United States.

'DS340W-FinalCode.ipynb' - Final code file, cleaned up version of modified code file, submitted alongside the final report and presentation.
